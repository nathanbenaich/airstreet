        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
        The State of AI Report is our comprehensive round-up of the most important developments of the year in AI research, industry, safety, and politics. I started co-producing the report in 2018 with fellow investor Ian Hogarth. After he took on the important role of leading the UK Government‚Äôs AI Safety Taskforce, it was a Team Air Street production in 2023. 
        </p>



        <p>
        The report is driven by the belief that if you want to be part of the AI community, then you have to be an active contributor. Dedicated researchers and practitioners don‚Äôt usually have the time to follow breakthroughs in every discipline or use case, so our aim is to provide an opinionated analysis  to serve as a practical field guide.
        </p>



        <p>
        Looking back over the past five years, the report serves as a historical document. It shows both how the capabilities of the field have advanced at a dizzying pace, as well as the impact this has had on industry and politics.
        </p>



        <p>
        You can find all the past reports on the State of AI Report <a href="https://www.stateof.ai/" target="_blank">website</a>, but to mark five years since our first edition, we‚Äôve gone back through 934 slides (without LLM assistance), and compiled some of the major storylines and where our predictions did (and didn‚Äôt) hit the mark.
        </p>

        <h3>Charting a half-decade overnight success: from transfer learning to the scaling of transformers into large language models (LLMs).</h3>

        <p>
        In our early reports, the research sections were dominated by reinforcement learning as DeepMind took an ax to seemingly every gaming benchmark it could find. This started with Go, then StarCraft II, then Quake II Arena Capture the Flag, followed by OpenAI entering the ring to crush Dota 2. 
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/1.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>
        Having started its life in games, DeepMind didn‚Äôt stay in the simulated world alone for long. In just a few years, they‚Äôd moved from StarCraft to controlling the core of a nuclear reactor.
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/2.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        Nevertheless, the generative AI boom won‚Äôt have come as a surprise to loyal State of AI readers. We may not have been calling them LLMs, but the precursors to the current generation of models were starting to show impressive results as early as 2018. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Back then, what we called transfer learning was enabling models trained on one natural language processing (NLP) task to work great on other NLP tasks by virtue of learning generally useful representations. 
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/3.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        It was soon clear that attention was indeed all you needed, and by 2020, transformers had surged from passing mention status to the MVP of the research section.
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/4.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        As a result, NLP was essentially ‚Äòsolved‚Äô by 2021‚Ä¶
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/5.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        OpenAI realized you could represent your data as a sequence of tokens, so a transformer could learn it, driving impressive results in image completion.
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/6.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        So transformers then expanded from vision into several other domains such as audio and 3D point clouds.
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/7.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        It also quickly became apparent that OpenAI was putting the pedal to the model scaling metal after seeing early success with GPT-2 (<i>‚ÄúLanguage Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners‚Äù, 2019</i>), leaving the rest of the field playing catch-up with GPT-3 (<i>‚ÄúLanguage Models are Few-Shot Learners‚Äù, 2020</i>):
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/8.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        This was crucial, as we‚Äôd seen evidence of the power of scaling laws as far back as 2015:
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>
                    <nav class="level">
                        <div class="level-item has-text-centered">
                            <figure class='image'><img class="figure" src='soai5y/9.png'>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </nav>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        From the first days of the report, we were tracking research showing the clear connection between compute, model size and data scale, and ultimate model performance.
        </p>

        <div class="container-figure has-text-centered">
            <div class='card-figure equal-height figure-container'>
                <div class='card-image'>

        As scale drove model performance, we began to see an interesting trend from 2022 onwards: models began to exhibit capabilities that had not been explicitly programmed by their developers. This was termed ‚Äúemergence‚Äù. And while it is exciting from a capabilities point of view, this phenomenon led to understandable safety fears.

This unlocked stable diffusion and the summer 2022 boom in image generation techniques.

        In the "agentic world", we saw the emergence of models like Dreamer, DreamerV2, DreamerV3, and PlaNet. They represented a shift towards model-based reinforcement learning, where agents not only learn a policy but also construct a world model that can be used for planning and decision-making. This allows the creation of agents that can generalize from past experience to achieve goals in complex environments.

As research groups found that more and more massive online scraping unlocked better performance, they began to make the investment. They also had the advantage of pre-training and fine-tuning being separate steps, meaning they could pick up a pre-trained base model and fine-tune it themselves.

        As China‚Äôs investments in capabilities increased sharply, western governments began to react and unveil dedicated defense AI investment packages. By this stage, Anduril had raised a $450M Series D and Palantir had IPO-ed, while big tech had resumed working on defense (very quietly).

        That said, as NVIDIA plowed on with R&D dedicated to this new wave of compute - as it has done several times in its history - and Big Tech explored developing its own hardware, we quickly concluded these start-ups faced an uphill battle. NVIDIA installed CUDA, its GPU programming framework, and its GPUs were too great to unseat. We repeatedly predicted the demise of some of these start-ups. While there have been downrounds, the consolidation we anticipated in 2021-2023 has not happened ‚Ä¶ yet.

        The report documented the emergence of the first national AI strategies in 2018 and 2019, before the tsunami that followed in later years. At the same time, Ian was documenting the trend in more detail in his well-received <a href="https://www.ianhogarth.com/blog/2018/6/13/ai-nationalism" target="_blank">essay</a> on AI Nationalism. With the exception of China‚Äôs, these largely lacked ambition. China had pledged a single $2.1 billion on a single line item, whereas the UK‚Äôs AI Sector Deal was worth ¬£603 million. Some things never change.

        Until 2022, the report didn‚Äôt have a dedicated safety section. This reflected how, beyond a small cadre of dedicated researchers, the industry was by and large uninterested in these questions.

        <p>
        The State of AI Report season is one of the most energizing times of the year. We get to document all the awesome work the community‚Äôs been doing, while forcing ourselves to think about what‚Äôs ahead. It wouldn‚Äôt be possible without our reviewers, the companies that contribute data, or the team that helps me produce it. And of course, thank you to the community for giving us so much to report on. See you in October 2024 for the next installment. You can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stateofaireport" target="_blank">Twitter here</a> or sign up to <a href="https://stateofai.substack.com/" target="_blank">our newsletter</a> to receive the next report in your inbox.
