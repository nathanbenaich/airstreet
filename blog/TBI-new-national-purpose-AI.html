        <h3>AI and the Future of Britain</h3>
        <p>
            I was invited to participate on a panel by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change during London Tech Week to mark the publication of their new report, <a href="https://www.institute.global/insights/politics-and-governance/new-national-purpose-ai-promises-world-leading-future-of-britain" target="_blank"><i>A New National Purpose: AI Promises a World-Leading Future</i></a>. The report makes some bold recommendations around large-scale investment in R&D and provides a much-needed assessment of how certain bodies, such as the Alan Turing Institute, have failed to deliver. It‚Äôs well-worth reading in full.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was on the panel with Darren Jones, the Labour MP and Chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, and Benedict Macon-Cooney, the Chief Policy Strategist at the TBI.
        </p>

        <p>
            We covered a wide range of topics, so I‚Äôve tidied up the notes I prepared ahead of time, grouped under the main themes of the panel, in case they‚Äôre of interest to others. There‚Äôs also some bonus content we didn‚Äôt end up covering during the discussion. You can watch the full recording of the panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13LtW3hIR7I" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>The strategies the UK should take to become world-leaders in AI</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
            Science and technology leadership requires us to overhaul the 19th century institutions that 21st century founders have to navigate. We can see this really clearly in two areas of policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, <b>founders trying to spin companies out of universities in crucial sectors like AI and the life sciences, face a lengthy, borderline feudal process.</b> 
        </p>
        <li> 
            I‚Äôve heard from over 200 founders via the spinout.fyi survey, where they‚Äôve detailed the untransparent negotiations, exorbitant equity stakes, and the royalties agreements they were forced to sign and how these then discouraged potential investors. 
        </li>
        <li>
            That‚Äôs why, despite possessing some of the world‚Äôs best universities for science and technology, only 5% of UK venture funding goes into spinouts.
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Secondly, if you‚Äôre an early-stage business facing a government procurement process, you‚Äôll find it captured by a small handful of incumbents, who are seen as the ‚Äòsafe‚Äô options.</b>
        </p>
        <li>
            In a sector like defence, innovative businesses will be fighting for small exploratory contracts worth a few million, while General Dynamics can waste over ¬£5 billion of public money on the Ajax tank. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Solving these challenges will require a combination of <b>direct government intervention (in the case of universities) and greater political courage and tolerance for failure (in the case of procurement).</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This needs to be matched with an acceptance that innovation can‚Äôt be done on the cheap. If you take something like the <b>National Compute Strategy - the goals are entirely correct, but the investment and the timelines just aren‚Äôt ambitious enough:</b>
        </p>
        <li>
            Spending ¬£900 million and a 3,000 GPU target when some corporate labs already have 10x this capacity. By contrast, Anthropic has suggested the US should invest $4 billion over three years to build a 100,000 GPU cluster.
        </li>
        <li>
            Targeting exascale for 2026 - it‚Äôs online in the private sector already.
        </li>

        <h3>AI‚Äôs opportunities and applications in public services.</h3>

        <p>
            There‚Äôs incredible potential, but the conversation <b>needs to move out of the realm of generalities</b>. It‚Äôs not realistic to think that AI will be equally suited to every challenge or that we can just bolt it onto our existing way of doing things.
        </p>
            While AI will no doubt help us run public services more efficiently in the long-run, it requires upfront effort and investment to prepare for it. For challenges to be AI-appropriate, we need <b>a clear, well-defined task, and large, high-quality datasets.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you take something like the UK healthcare system, you have large quantities of legacy technology, paper records, and data that requires extensive cleaning before it can be used for training. You also have in-house teams who‚Äôve never had to vast data-sharing contracts with technology companies.
        </p>
        <li>
            That‚Äôs why, for example, if you take DeepMind‚Äôs past work in the NHS, they abandoned their original plans to use AI <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/why-doesnt-streams-use-ai" target="_blank">and focused on building a task management app for clinicians.</a>
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Alongside investment, <b>we‚Äôll also need a shift in mindset.</b> We‚Äôll have to become significantly more comfortable with the government sharing data with industry - we‚Äôve already seen successive governments propose changes here only to <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/care-data-nhs-england-closed" target="_blank">abandon</a> <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/emea/uk-government-halts-gp-data-sharing-scheme-after-mistakes-were-made" target="_blank">them</a> following public opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to have <b>a mature conversation about the trade-offs: there‚Äôs no world where we can build high-quality, technology-first public services that don‚Äôt require any money, data, or private sector involvement.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>How the UK can collaborate effectively with its allies.</h3>
        <p>
            <b>We need to swallow our pride and do everything we can to rejoin Horizon as quickly as possible</b> - the UK is quibbling about the bill while holding a very weak hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UK has historically been one of the <b>largest beneficiaries of Horizon</b> and the government‚Äôs argument that we deserve a discount because participation from British scientists is low seems to ignore the fact that this stems from the uncertainty created by their own policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other avenue that has a lot of potential is NATO. We‚Äôve seen the alliance really engage on AI-related issues in the past few years - whether it was <b><a href="https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/10/25/an-artificial-intelligence-strategy-for-nato/index.html" target="_blank">releasing an AI strategy in 2021</a>, pressing on with plans to pursue its own <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_211498.htm#:~:text=Its%20aim%20is%20to%20translate,of%20governability%2C%20traceability%20and%20reliability." target="_blank">responsible AI certification standards</a>, and creating <a href="https://www.diana.nato.int/" target="_blank">DIANA</a> to back early-stage developers of dual-use technologies.</b> 
        </p>
        <p>
            We‚Äôve heard Rishi Sunak talk about his aspirations to make the UK an international centre for AI safety. If we‚Äôre to do this, we need to start rebuilding credibility and <b>increasing our visibility and participation within multilateral institutions seems like a good place to start.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>What practical steps the government should take to address the risks of AI.</h3>

        <p>
            I think it‚Äôs important we <b>restore some balance to the conversation around AI risk.</b> In recent months, it feels as though the conversation has been taken over by two different groups: a vocal minority prioritising extinction fears and big technology companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far, absolutely no one has been able to demonstrate the pathway from current capabilities to a ‚ÄòGod-like AI‚Äô bent on the destruction of the world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you‚Äôre <b>trying to push for policy change, but can‚Äôt describe the risk you‚Äôre mitigating against - that‚Äôs not good enough.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, while many of the people who work for technology companies are sincere when they talk about AI risk, it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time an industry with deep pockets and big compliance teams has pushed for more regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, it‚Äôs not hard to understand why companies <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" target="_blank">competing against open source</a> would be in favour of a government-run licensing system for models.
        </p>
        <p>    
            So far, the UK has been getting the balance right: identifying the specific harms that we‚Äôre trying to mitigate against and empowering existing regulators. This allows us to tackle real-world harms without creating additional real-world complexity.
