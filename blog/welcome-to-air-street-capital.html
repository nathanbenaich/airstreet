        <h3>Investing in AI-first technology and life science companies</h3>

        <p>Today, we announce Air Street Capital and our new $17 million fund that represents the future of global AI investing. Generalism is dead, and to be the partner of choice for AI-first founders in both Europe and the US, you need AI-native investors.</p>

        <p>Our thesis is clear: AI is the most compelling force multiplier on technological progress in our increasingly digital, data-driven world. This is because everything around us today, ranging from culture to consumer products, is the result of intelligence.
            We believe that tomorrow‚Äôs category-leading companies will be AI-first by design.</p>

        <h3>Our approach</h3>

        <p>Air Street Capital draws on a deep bench of AI-native Operating Partners - founders and researchers who have built their careers in AI-first software, and who are sharing back the emerging playbook of building best-in-class AI-first technology
            products and companies with our portfolio founders. We‚Äôre honoured to have Phil Keslin (Niantic), Gaile Gordon (TYZX, acquired by Intel), Julien Cornebise and Gabriel Dulac-Arnold (Google Research, DeepMind), as well as Jan Erik Solem (Facebook,
            Mapillary) on our team, amongst others.</p>

        <p>We believe this combination of AI expertise with deep sector-specific knowledge is going to accelerate the success of the next generation of enduring companies. Our portfolio so far confirms this: companies like Graphcore are gaining huge traction
            to power a whole generation of AI-first software, while Anagenex, LabGenius and ZOE are all exemplifying how AI-first approaches can unlock previously intractable opportunities in the life sciences.</p>

        <p>The approach we take to investing and supporting AI-native founders at the seed stage is a novel one in Europe. The opportunity is obvious, with almost <a href="https://www.stateof.ai">one-quarter of top global AI talent</a> earning their undergraduate
            and graduate degrees here. With the rapid pace of AI technology breakthroughs in academia and open source, even the knowledge gained during a PhD completed a few years ago dates quickly. As natives of the AI ecosystem ourselves, our day-to-day
            exposure to projects of all shapes and sizes and our work with the RAAIS community and the State of AI Report gives us an edge: a prepared mind. Seeing the present clearly let‚Äôs us build conviction quickly.</p>

        <h3>The opportunity</h3>

        <p>The European ecosystem to-date has offered fewer specialist investors than the US, and we believe there is enormous value to be created from early partnerships. From Facebook‚Äôs acquisition of Mapillary 6 years after our team‚Äôs Seed investment
            in 2014, to Sequoia‚Äôs investment into Air Street-backed Graphcore, international investors are taking notice of European AI companies at the later stages. At Air Street Capital, we specialise in identifying high-potential opportunities early
            on, and we work closely with our founders to iterate through product, market and technology strategy from day 1 through to Series A and beyond.</p>

        <p>We are honoured to have earned the trust of global limited partners who are committed to our mission, including Twitter, Vitruvian Partners, Google Senior Fellow Jeff Dean, Supercell co-founder Ilkka Paananen, Unity co-founder David Helgason,
            Point Nine Capital co-founder Christoph Janz, and LocalGlobe & Basecamp co-founders Robin and Saul Klein.</p>

        <p>If you‚Äôre an entrepreneur building AI-first solutions, from infrastructure through to applications, to solve the most pressing challenges in your field we‚Äôd <a href="mailto:nathan@airstreet.com">love to hear from you</a>.</p>
