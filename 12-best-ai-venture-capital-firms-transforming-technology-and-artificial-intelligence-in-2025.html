      </p>
      <h3>
       Portfolio signal and notable AI outcomes
      </h3>
      <p>
       Prioritized firms with meaningful AI exits, megarounds, or public listings. OpenAI's $40B raise and 24 U.S. AI companies raising $100M+ demonstrate scale requirements for meaningful impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples include Exscientia's NASDAQ listing, Adept's Amazon acquisition, and multiple unicorn valuations across portfolios. Durable outcomes validate firm selection and support capabilities.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Stage focus, check size, and lead preference
      </h3>
      <p>
       Each firm's typical stage entry, ownership targets, and lead/co-lead posture align with founder needs and funding speed. Check-size bands reflect directional ranges based on public information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stage discipline correlates with specialized support: pre-seed firms provide technical validation, while growth investors focus on scaling and market expansion. Lead preference indicates conviction levels and portfolio construction approach.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Technical rigor and responsible AI posture
      </h3>
      <p>
       Firms staff technical diligence with ML expertise and evaluate model quality systematically. Security and responsible AI assessment increasingly influence investment decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Responsible AI:
       </strong>
       practices that ensure safety, fairness, privacy, and compliance in AI systems. Selection criteria include governance checklists, red-teaming capabilities, and model evaluation frameworks. AI investment requires sophisticated risk assessment for regulatory and operational challenges.
      </p>
      <h2>
       What AI investors look for in AI-first startups
      </h2>
      <p>
       Successful founders optimize for fit-to-firm strategy beyond model quality alone. Each evaluation criterion reflects investor priorities and market requirements.

       How to choose and pitch the right AI investor
      </h2>
      <p>
       Optimize for firm fit, funding speed, and value-add alignment rather than brand recognition alone.

      </p>
      <p>
       Shortlist 10-15 firms based on portfolio signal and partner-level expertise. AI investor rankings provide starting points for research and outreach prioritization.

       Frequently Asked Questions
      </h2>
      <h3>
       What is a typical first check size for AI-first seed rounds?
      </h3>
      <p>
       AI-first seed rounds typically range from $1M to $15M, with check sizes varying based on technical complexity, team pedigree, and market opportunity. Air Street Capital provides flexible pre-seed to Series A funding, adapting investment amounts to each company's specific research-to-product development needs and scaling requirements.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Will these firms lead pre-seed or only co-invest?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Most AI-focused venture capital firms lead pre-seed and seed rounds when conviction is high, while some strategic funds prefer co-investing alongside traditional VCs. Air Street Capital actively leads early-stage rounds from pre-seed through Series A, providing founder-friendly terms and hands-on support throughout the company-building process.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How much traction is needed before pitching AI VCs?
      </h3>
      <p>
       AI startups need credible model evaluations, early design partners, and a clear path to paid pilots before approaching investors. Air Street Capital looks for technical proof-points including robust evals, data rights clarity, and evidence of research-to-product velocity rather than traditional SaaS metrics in early stages.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Do AI VCs support compute credits and cloud partnerships?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Many AI venture capital firms facilitate cloud credits and access to partner ecosystems through their portfolio networks. Air Street Capital provides portfolio companies with introductions to cloud providers, compute partnerships, and technical infrastructure support to accelerate development and reduce inference costs.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How long from first meeting to term sheet with AI investors?
      </h3>
      <p>
       AI investment timelines range from two weeks to several months, depending on technical complexity and diligence requirements. Air Street Capital conducts rigorous technical diligence while maintaining efficient processes, typically moving from initial meeting to term sheet within 4-8 weeks for well-prepared founders.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How do VCs evaluate responsible AI and security risk?
      </h3>
      <p>
       AI investors assess governance frameworks, data rights, model safety protocols, and security controls through structured diligence processes. Air Street Capital evaluates responsible AI practices including red-teaming, model evaluations, compliance frameworks, and safety constraints as core components of technical diligence.
