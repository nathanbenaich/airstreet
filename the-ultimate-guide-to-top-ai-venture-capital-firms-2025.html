       $100 billion in 2024, up 80% from $55.6 billion in 2023. Investors now prioritize revenue, margins, and unit economics over pure growth metrics.

      <h3>
       Funding trends and why AI dominates venture
      </h3>
      <p>
       Capital concentration into AI reflects four key drivers: model capability leaps, enterprise adoption, infrastructure build-out, and new application markets. Enterprise adoption accelerates as CIOs fund automation, code assistants, and agentic workflows showing clear ROI. Infrastructure cycles attract large, durable spending on compute, data infrastructure, and model tooling. Application unlocks emerge as vertical models and copilots advance from pilots to paid rollouts.

       How to evaluate the best VC firms for AI
      </h2>
      <p>
       Evaluate AI-focused VCs using a weighted scoring framework across four critical dimensions. Use a 1-5 scale with these weights: Focus (30%), Technical depth (30%), Platform support (25%), and Outcomes (15%). This approach helps founders systematically assess which firms truly understand AI-first businesses versus those adding AI as an afterthought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus measures AI portfolio density, fund mandates, and partner time allocation. Technical depth evaluates partner backgrounds, research ties, and diligence processes. Platform support covers talent access, compute resources, GTM assistance, and safety frameworks. Outcomes track follow-on rates, exits, and syndicate quality.

       How to pick and pitch the right AI investor
      </h2>
      <p>
       Successful AI fundraising requires systematic investor selection and preparation. Follow this framework: shortlist based on stage and focus alignment, prepare comprehensive data rooms, run efficient processes, and close with favorable terms including pro rata rights and governance structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Match investors to your specific needs across stage, check size, technical depth, and platform resources. Prepare data rooms showcasing technical differentiation, unit economics, and customer traction. Execute disciplined outreach with clear timelines and regular updates.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Matching stage, check size, and lead behavior

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Pre-seed ($250K-$1M):

         Focus on AI specialists with technical backgrounds and rapid decision processes
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Seed ($1M-$5M):
         </strong>
         Target firms with AI platform resources and follow-on capabilities
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>

         Prioritize leads with enterprise networks and growth-stage partnerships
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Trade-offs exist between single-lead simplicity and multi-party syndicates. Single leads offer cleaner governance but may limit platform access. Syndicates provide broader expertise but require more coordination.

      <p>
       Compute-aware unit economics require modeling costs across model choices, context sizes, and inference hardware. Margin expansion levers include caching strategies, model fine-tuning, and intelligent routing. Tie metrics to buyer outcomes: time saved, accuracy improvements, incident reduction, or revenue lift.

       Frequently Asked Questions
      </h2>
      <h3>
       Do AI VCs require proprietary models or is orchestration acceptable?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Air Street Capital accepts orchestration-based companies with strong data advantages, robust evaluations, and clear unit economics. While proprietary models provide differentiation, customer outcomes, gross margins above 70%, and safety frameworks matter more for sustainable AI-first businesses.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How do investors assess compute costs and unit economics for AI?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Air Street Capital models per-task costs across model choices, context sizes, and hardware configurations to project gross margin trajectories. The firm prioritizes companies with clear paths to margin expansion via caching strategies, fine-tuning optimization, and intelligent model routing that reduces inference costs.

      <h3>
       Will a corporate venture arm lead my round and what are the trade-offs?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Some corporate VCs lead rounds, but many prefer participation roles—confirm lead appetite early. Corporate backing provides distribution channels and technical validation but may introduce strategic constraints. Air Street Capital leads rounds at seed and Series A stages with follow-on reserves and no strategic conflicts.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How do VCs diligence data rights, model licenses, and AI safety?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Air Street Capital reviews data provenance documentation, third-party license agreements, and safety testing including red-teaming results and monitoring frameworks. The firm's technical team conducts reproducible evaluations against public benchmarks and customer-specific tasks to validate model performance and safety posture.
      </p>
      <h3>
       What traction is typical at pre-seed, seed, and Series A for AI-first companies?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Air Street Capital prioritizes engaged design partners, repeatable use cases, and improving unit economics over vanity metrics. Strong candidates show paid pilots, retention above 80%, and measurable customer outcomes like time savings or accuracy gains that translate to clear ROI.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How do firms handle portfolio conflicts in AI infrastructure or foundation models?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Air Street Capital discloses potential overlaps, creates ethical walls between portfolio companies, and avoids direct competitors when possible. The firm maintains explicit conflict policies and provides references from portfolio founders about handling competitive situations while supporting all companies fairly.
